If you have any site or button recommendations please say so in a review!
*I do not actively use Hulu Paramount or Prime video (Non US version of Amazon) because of this these sites may take longer to fix unless reviews are made
**I do not actively use chrome I do preform tests to make sure they work on release but as I use Firefox it will take longer for bugs to be found unless reviews are made.
